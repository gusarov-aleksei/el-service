WHAT ELSE DOES IT MEAN?

to submit
The verb “to submit,” in this podcast, means to officially give or send something
to a person or organization, especially when that person or organization will
review and/or approve it: “We’re supposed to submit our essays to the professor
by email by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.”  The verb “to submit” also means to accept
the authority and power of another person or organization over oneself: “Do you
believe that modern women should submit themselves to their husband as in the
past, or should they be more independent now?”  Or, “Lou doesn’t want to submit
to the authorities in any way, so he refuses to pay taxes.”  In a court of law,
lawyers “submit evidence,” or present arguments, documents, videos, and tapes
that help them argue their side of the case: “The lawyers submitted a lot of
evidence to show that the man was guilty.”

document
In this podcast, the word “document” means an official piece of paper that
provides information about something: “Please send us your university diploma
or another document that proves you studied there.”  A “document” can also be
an electronic computer file: “How can I open a new Word document?”  Or, “Try to
save the changes to your document at least every 10 minutes.”  As a verb, “to
document” means to write down information about something so that it isn’t
forgotten: “All the current employees were asked to document their work
processes so that it would be easier for new employees to learn how to do their
job.”  Something that is “documented” has been written down with many details:
“The development of nuclear power is well documented.”


CULTURE NOTE

The U.S. “Department of State” (the part of the U.S. government involved in
international relations) “issues” (creates and shares) travel “advisories”
(information and recommendations) for U.S. citizens who are considering
traveling to other countries.  It issues two types of travel advisories: Travel Alerts
and Travel Warnings.

A “Travel Alert” is used to share information about short-term conditions that may
“pose” (present) “risks” (things that may cause hurt, damage, or death if they
happen) to U.S. citizens in the area.  Travel Alerts might describe important
conferences or sporting events, “demonstrations” (protests), elections, terrorist
activity, and “natural disasters” (earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, etc.).  Right now,
many of the Travel Alerts are about “swine flu” (H1N1) and the “quarantine
measures” (efforts to separate sick people from healthy people) that some
countries are “engaged” (involved) in.

A “Travel Warning” is used to share information about long-term conditions that
make it dangerous for Americans to be in a country.  Travel Warnings are used
when the “embassy” or “consulate” (official government presence in another
country) is closed or has limited staff.  When this happens, U.S. citizens in that
country will not receive very much assistance from the government if something
bad happens to them.

The Department of State also offers country-specific information to help U.S.
citizens learn more about the country they will be traveling to.  This information
includes the location of the U.S. sembassy or consulate, “visa requirements”
(documents needed to enter a country), local health, and “vaccination” (injections
to prevent diseases) recommendations, as well as information about local crime.

This episode is called “Applying for a Passport.”  It’s a dialogue between Orlando
and someone at the passport office.  It’s going to be using a lot of vocabulary
related to getting a passport, at least here in the United States.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk:  Yes, can I help you?

Orlando:  I want to get a passport.

Clerk:  Have you filled out the application?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  Come back when you’ve filled it out.

Orlando:  Okay, I’ve completed the application.

Clerk:  Let me see it.  You need to fill in your Social Security number here and
you need to provide evidence of your citizenship.  Have you ever had a passport
before?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  In that case, you’ll need to submit a copy of your birth certificate, or if you
were born outside of the country, a copy of your Naturalization Certificate or a
Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

Orlando:  I don’t have those documents with me.


Clerk:  Come back when you do.

Orlando:  Okay, I’m back.  I have a copy of my birth certificate.

Clerk:  All right.  Let me see some identification.

Orlando:  Identification?

Clerk:  Yes, I need to see a valid driver’s license, a government ID, or a military
ID.

Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

Clerk:  Yes?

Orlando:  Here’s my military ID.

Clerk:  Where are you passport photos?

Orlando:  Passport photos?

Clerk:  Yes, you need two identical passport photos.

Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the clerk, the person who is working at the passport
office, saying to Orlando, “Yes, can I help you?”  “Can I help you?” or “May I help
you?” mean the same thing.  I should also point out that although you can get a
passport by going to the U.S. government passport office, most people get their
passports at the Post Office; that’s where you submit your application.

Orlando says, “I want to get a passport,” which you probably know is a small,
official book that is given to you by your government that allows you to travel to
other countries.  The clerk says, “Have you filled out (have you completed) the
application (the form that requests all the information about you)?”  Orlando says,
“No, I haven’t.”  The clerk says, “Come back when you’ve filled it out (when
you’ve completed it).”


So Orlando goes away, he comes back, and he says, “Okay, I’ve completed the
application.”  The clerk says, “Let me see it,” please allow me to look at it – the
clerk isn’t actually that polite.  She says, “You need to fill in (to write in) your
Social Security number here.”  The “Social Security number” is a number that
pretty much everyone in the United States has, issued by the government – the
government gives you this number.  Usually you get the number when you are a
young child, or even a baby.  It identifies you.  It is a number that is typically only
given to people who have legal permission to be here in the United States.
Social Security is also the name of a program that provides money for those who
need money to live on, especially those who are old.  It’s sort of like our national
retirement system – except they don’t have very much money!  The Social
Security number, then, is one thing that you have to put on almost every official
application that you fill out in the U.S.

The clerk tells Orlando he also needs evidence of his citizenship.  “Evidence,”
here, means the same as proof; evidence would be a written document that
supports what you are saying.  In this case, Orlando is saying “I am a U.S.
citizen,” and the clerk is telling him he has to prove that – he has to show that.
“Citizenship” means, of course, belonging to a particular country.  Some people
have dual citizenship; they are citizens of more than one country – two countries
if it’s dual citizenship.  I suppose you could have citizenship in more than two
countries, it would be a little unusual

Orlando is asked if he has ever had a passport before.  Passports in the United
States are typically issued, or given to you, and they are good for 10 years; every
10 years you have to get a new passport.  Orlando says, “No, I haven’t (I haven’t
had a passport before).”  The clerk says, “In that case (in this situation), you’ll
need to submit a copy of your birth certificate.”  “To submit” (submit) means to
officially give or send something to someone or to some organization, especially
if that organization has to review or approve whatever it is that you are sending
in.  So for example, you could submit a job application.  You could give the
company an application, they would look at it and see if they want to hire you – to
have you work for them.  The word “submit” has a couple of different meanings in
English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Well, the clerk is asking Orlando for his “birth certificate.”  This is an official piece
of paper that shows your complete name, when and where you were born, who
your parents are, and typically the name of the hospital, although that isn’t
always on the birth certificate.  Every state has its own birth certificate system;
there is not a national birth certificate system in the U.S.  If I wanted to get my
birth certificate I would have to go back, or write – nowadays email – the
Minnesota government office that takes care of birth certificates.  Within a given

state, mostly the birth certificates are arranged by county.  A “county” is a smaller
division within state.  Minnesota, for example, has 87 counties – 87 different
regions.  In fact, it has more counties than any other state in the United States for
some reason.  I would have to go back to the county I was born in, Ramsey
County, which is where St. Paul is, and ask for a copy of my birth certificate.

I actually did that when I was…I don’t know…12 years old maybe, and we
discovered – I discovered that my parents had not officially put a name in for me
on the birth certificate.  They hadn’t decided what they were going to call me.
Remember, I’m the youngest of 11 children, so they had sort of gone through all
of the names that they wanted.  Well, because they didn’t know my name by the
time my mother left the hospital, the birth certificate simply said “Baby Boy
McQuillan.”  I had to then officially prove to the county that my legal name was
Jeffrey – that’s my full name, and I had to provide them evidence that I have
used this name all of my life.  But for the first 12 years of my existence on this
earth I was officially known as Baby Boy McQuillan, which is actually a good
name since I was the youngest in the family, and we often call the youngest in
the family the baby of the family – even if they’re 46 years old!  I’m still the baby
of the family.

Back to Orlando: Orlando has to get a birth certificate, or if he was born outside
of the United States he needs a copy of either his Naturalization Certificate or
something called a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  A “Naturalization
Certificate” is an official piece of paper showing that you were once a citizen of
another country, but then you became a U.S. citizen.  So if you move here after
20 years of living in, say, Japan or France or South Africa – wherever, and you
want to become a U.S. citizen you have to get what is called “naturalized.”  You
become a citizen, and that process is called “naturalization.”  So, a
“Naturalization Certificate” is a certificate proving that you officially became a
U.S. citizen on this particular day; it’s not your birth certificate.  If you have an
American mother or father, or both, and you are born in another country you’re
still an American citizen.  However, because you will not have a birth certificate
from a U.S. hospital you need to go to the local embassy or consulate and get a
Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  An “embassy” is the main headquarters of
representatives from your government in another country.  Usually the
embassies are in the capital cities of the other countries; here in the United
States, they would be in Washington, D.C.  Many governments also have small
offices called “consulates” that are in other cities in the United States or in a
different country.  So for example, here in Los Angeles there is a consulate for
the government of Mexico, a consulate for China, a consulate for Spain.  Dozens
of other countries have consulates in big U.S. cities, especially cities that may
have a lot of citizens from their country.  The U.S. has consulates in other cities,

in addition to embassies, in other countries.  A “consular,” then, refers to the
notion of a representative; “consul,” here, is more generally a representative of
your government.  Consular Report of Birth Aboad; “abroad” simply means in
another country.  So it’s sort of like a birth certificate but it comes from the U.S.
State Department, from either an embassy or a consulate, that shows that you
are, in fact, an American citizen.

Well, Orlando says he doesn’t have any of these things.  He says, “I don’t have
those documents (those official pieces of paper) with me.”  A “document” can
mean a couple of different things.  Once again, take a look at the Learning Guide
for some more explanations.  So the clerk says to Orlando, “Come back when
you do,” meaning come back here when you have one of these official
documents.  So he goes, and comes back again and gives his birth certificate to
the clerk.  The clerk then says, “Let me see some identification (let me see
something that proves that you are who you are).”  Usually that means either a
valid driver’s license, a government ID, or a military ID.  A “driver’s license” is
issued, or given, by each state, that says you have permission to drive in that
state, and in any other state, but you need at least one driver’s license from one
state.  A “valid” driver’s license just means a driver’s license that is current, that
was issued recently.  A “government ID” is identification that is given by the
government, perhaps another government agency besides the state where you
live.  A “military ID (or identification)” is a card that says you are a member of the
Army, the Navy, the Air Force, or the Marines, and that you work in that
organization.

So Orlando has to leave again, he comes back, he says, “Here’s my military ID.”
The clerk then asks, “Where are you passport photos?”  In order to get a
passport you have to have two pictures taken of yourself, and you need to bring
them and give them with your application to the government representative in
order to get a passport.  Passport photos are very small, and are just of your
head.  Well of course, Orlando doesn’t have the passport photos.  The clerk
says, “Yes, you’ll need two identical (or the same) photographs.”  Orlando says,
“I’ll be right back,” and leaves again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk:  Yes, can I help you?

Orlando:  I want to get a passport.


Clerk:  Have you filled out the application?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  Come back when you’ve filled it out.

Orlando:  Okay, I’ve completed the application.

Clerk:  Let me see it.  You need to fill in your Social Security number here and
you need to provide evidence of your citizenship.  Have you ever had a passport
before?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  In that case, you’ll need to submit a copy of your birth certificate, or if you
were born outside of the country, a copy of your Naturalization Certificate or a
Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

Orlando:  I don’t have those documents with me.

Clerk:  Come back when you do.

Orlando:  Okay, I’m back.  I have a copy of my birth certificate.

Clerk:  All right.  Let me see some identification.

Orlando:  Identification?

Clerk:  Yes, I need to see a valid driver’s license, a government ID, or a military
ID.

Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

Clerk:  Yes?

Orlando:  Here’s my military ID.

Clerk:  Where are you passport photos?

Clerk:  Yes, you need two identical passport photos.


Orlando:  I’ll be right back.
