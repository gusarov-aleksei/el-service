to submit
The verb “to submit,” in this podcast, means to officially give or send something
to a person or organization, especially when that person or organization will
review and/or approve it: “We’re supposed to submit our essays to the professor
by email by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.”  The verb “to submit” also means to accept
the authority and power of another person or organization over oneself: “Do you
believe that modern women should submit themselves to their husband as in the
past, or should they be more independent now?”  Or, “Lou doesn’t want to submit
to the authorities in any way, so he refuses to pay taxes.”  In a court of law,
lawyers “submit evidence,” or present arguments, documents, videos, and tapes
that help them argue their side of the case: “The lawyers submitted a lot of
evidence to show that the man was guilty.”

document
In this podcast, the word “document” means an official piece of paper that
provides information about something: “Please send us your university diploma
or another document that proves you studied there.”  A “document” can also be
an electronic computer file: “How can I open a new Word document?”  Or, “Try to
save the changes to your document at least every 10 minutes.”  As a verb, “to
document” means to write down information about something so that it isn’t
forgotten: “All the current employees were asked to document their work
processes so that it would be easier for new employees to learn how to do their
job.”  Something that is “documented” has been written down with many details:
“The development of nuclear power is well documented.”
