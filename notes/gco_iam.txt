==================== Identity and Access Management (IAM) =======================
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview

This component of GCP defines access to GCP resources. Everything is resource.
Here is base statements of IAM:
Resource - service of GCP: Projects, VM instances, GKE, Storage, etc.
Principal - somebody or someone authenticated in system.
Identity - Principal reflected in IAM (can be of different type: id or email of account, groups, allUsers). Identity has set of Roles granted to Principal.
Role - set of permissions. Roles are granted to Principals. Permission format is 'service.resource.verb'.
Policy - set of Roles attached to Resource and set of Roles bound to Principal (Member in terms of Policy)
IAM checks Policy of Resource to determine if action is permitted for Principal with some assigned Role.
Resource has hierarchy structure with inherited Policies: Organization -> Folder -> Project -> Resource

List policies of 'algus-project-382' project:
gcloud projects get-iam-policy algus-project-382 --format=json > ./algus-project-policy.json

Best practice is to create new service account and grant additional Roles instead of using default service accounts(or adding auth scopes to instance used default service account):
Create new service-account
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account

Steps are: 1) create account 2) assign policies 3) stop instance 4) assign account to instance 5) start instance

gcloud iam service-accounts create algus-el-service --description "Account for file processing" --display-name="File processor instance"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding algus-project-382 --member=serviceAccount:algus-el-service@algus-project-382.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/storage.objectAdmin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding algus-project-382 --member=serviceAccount:algus-el-service@algus-project-382.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/artifactregistry.reader

gcloud compute instances stop el-service-vm
gcloud compute instances set-service-account el-service-vm --service-account algus-el-service@algus-project-382.iam.gserviceaccount.com --scopes=cloud-platform
gcloud compute instances start el-service-vm

Access to GCP API is managed by scope flag, for ex: --scopes=cloud-platform
See: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/set-service-account

Info about roles existing in GCP:
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles

List service-accounts:
gcloud iam service-accounts list

To display which service-account is used by instance:
gcloud compute instances describe el-service-vm --format="yaml(name,status,serviceAccounts)"

Set service account to instance for GCP authorization:
